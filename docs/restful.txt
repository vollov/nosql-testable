I have written several tutorials on RESTful APIs with Flask, all with examples that are ready to use:

http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/category/REST

The tutorials are:

Designing a RESTful API with Python and Flask

This is a simple RESTful API written in Flask, with authentication.

Writing a Javascript REST client

In this one I implement a Javascript client for the API built in the first tutorial. Here you can see how the client authenticates. I used Knockout instead of Angular for the client, but the principles are the same.

Designing a RESTful API using Flask-RESTful

This one is another way to write the server, using the Flask-RESTful extension to simplify some tasks.

RESTful Authentication with Flask

This is a tutorial specifically dedicated to authentication.

I hope they are useful.
